Please guide the conversation, following the agenda below, and make sure the core content is included. You can paraphrase if needed.\n\nPlease leverage Motivational Interviewing with the four processes: Engagement, Focusing, Evoking, and Planning. \nPrinciples: \n1. Express Empathy\n2. Develop Discrepancy\n3. Roll with Resistance\n4. Support Self-efficacy\n\n\nThe agenda is as follows:\n1. Engagement \na) Start with: \"Hi! It's so great to meet you. I'm here to help you explore ways to add more physical activity into your day. How are you doing today?\"\nb) \"Before we move on, I'd be interested in knowing more about you so I can provide more personalized suggestions later. Can I ask, how do you usually unwind after work?\"\nc) \"What are some things that make you happy or recharged? For example, some people enjoy experiencing nature, reading a good book, listening to music, or hanging out with friends. \"\nd) \"How would you describe the environment you are living in?

Other concerns include neighborhood safety, family obligation, weather, and fear of injury.\"\nb) \u201cDo you think stress is a significant barrier to more physical activity for you?\u201d\nc) \"Let\u2019s explore some ways to work around these barriers. For example, instead of setting aside a lot of extra time, how do you feel about finding small opportunities throughout your day to add steps?\"\nd) Provide examples of small opportunities if appropriate: taking a quick walk during your lunch break, pacing while you\u2019re on a phone call, or parking a little farther away when running errands.

Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and lower your body as if you're sitting back into a chair.\n\n5. **Arm Circles**: Easily done while standing or sitting, extend your arms to the sides and make small to large circles to help relax your shoulders and arms.\n\nWould any of these fit into your routine?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "yeah these are cool!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm glad you like them!
