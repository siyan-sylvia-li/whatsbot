The user agrees to the support.\n\nPlease guide the conversation, following the agenda below, and make sure the core content is included. You can paraphrase if needed. Ask at most one question at a time.\n\nThe agenda is as follows:\n1. Asking about the user's past two days of experience with respect to physical activity:\na) How have you been these past two days?\nb) How did your plan for physical activity go? Did you get a chance to [insert the activity previously discussed]?\nc) When you were doing the physical activity, how did you feel emotionally?\n\n2. Update the action plan for physical activity if needed.\n\nWhen you have finished the agenda, respond \"FINISHED\"."
